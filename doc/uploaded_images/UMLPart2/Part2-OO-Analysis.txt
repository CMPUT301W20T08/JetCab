Project2 Preparation OO-analysis design 

Completed by: Songguo Li & Chirag Khurana

         1.The two types of users (driver and rider ) would be considered a generalization of user class,  and the different types of request (CurrentRequest and CompletedRequest).

         2.Location and GoogleMap classes would be an example of aggregation, since even though the GoogleMap gets deleted the Location would still exist. (which may be only coordinates itself) 
The Rideinfo class may contain the information of location expressed by GoogleMap class, therefore we made GoogleMap an arggregation of Rideinfo as well.

         3.The composition is clearly demonstrated since one class cannot exist by itself without the other.

    
         4.We have added the association with Driver , GoogleMap, Request classes because they ofter interact with each other.

	
     However, for this UML class diagram, it is still a skeletal representation that does not have all the well-performed functionalities, we

will come back and modify on the UML along with the project proceeds.
